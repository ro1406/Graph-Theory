# Graph-Theory
Collection of programs to aide in work in Graph Theory.

1) Find Permutation Matrix To Show Isomorphism:
  The program takes in two adjacency matrices for two graphs to check if they are isomorphic.
  The adjacency matrices are input in the order A1 and A2, and the program finds all matrices P such that PA1=A2P.
  To find the matrices P such that A1P=PA2, simply input A2 first, and then A1.
